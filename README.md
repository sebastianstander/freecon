A collection of python programs that will (eventually) be able to :
  - Scrape data from some popular social media sites
  - Apply natural language parsing to acquire more insight.
  - Organize said data into relational format.
  - Interface with an RDBM in order to be queried.

# Planned Structure
1. Webscraper, built in Selenium for Javascript, using the ChromeDriver.
2. Natural Language Parsing Tools, written as a static library in modern (c++20+) c++ library.
3. An integrated database generating/accessing tool using either Python or Javascript with MongoDB.
4. Front End Visualization tools, using common Web Technologies (HTML,CSS,JS with React & D3 Libraries).
